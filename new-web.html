  Greetings World, Anneliese here!
  </div>

    <div>
      Just an everyday Disney, Stars Wars, and Harry Potter nerd.
    </div>
    <div>
    I have more fandoms I love but those are the main ones.
    </div>
    <div>
    Some are facts about me relating to the big three fandoms I love.
    </div>
    <div>
      My favorite Disney movie is Mulan, who is also my favorite Princess and my favorite villain is Hades.
    </div>
    <div>
    I would love to travel to Naboo and my favorite character is probably a tie between Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi and I would want a blue lightsaber.
    </div>
    <div>
      I am a very proud Slytherin and my favorite character is Draco Malfoy (heâ€™s a terrible human but so entertaining) and my favorite spell is probably Accio, because it seems the most useful.
